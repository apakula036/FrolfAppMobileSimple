A Frisbee Golf score keeper app that works on your phone or desktop when you open the frolfAppV2.html file. This app keeps track of when you start the round, end the round, and your score for the round as well as previous rounds through cookies. This is programmed entirely in JavaScript with the HTML and CSS all tucked into one file for easy and convenient use. 


#instructions
To open the app on your phone:
1. Download the frolfAppV2.html file
2. Select a course or create a custom course.
3. When you're ready to start the round, hit the "Start Round" button.
4. When playing, adjust your score manually for each hole or use the mobile friendly buttons to add or subtract points.
5. When you've finished the round, select the "End Round" button to finalize your score and see a score breakdown.
6. To start a new round, refresh the page to get back to the main menu where you'll now see your score saved. To delete a score sheet press the X beside the score. 

#additonal-info
This is a cookie based system to save the score so this wont last forever and clearing your cookies will delete your scores. 

#future-plans
I want to add a real database connection to keep scores longer and a way to sign in to see those scores on different devices. 
I also want to clean up the look and feel of it to be a bit more modern.
